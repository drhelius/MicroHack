# Walkthrough Challenge 3 - Create the Container App

Duration: 60 minutes

## Prerequisites

Please make sure that you have successfully completed [Challenge 2](../challenge-2/solution.md) before continuing with this challenge.

## **Task 1: Create the Container App and the Environment**

Open the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and navigate to the resource group where you deployed the Container Registry. Click *Create* in the top left corner and search for *Container App*, select the *Container App* resource and hit *Create*.

You are now in the wizard to create both a Container App Environment and the Container App itself. The Environment is comparable to an App Service and is used as a runtime to manage resources that are shared by multiple apps. The Container Apps themselves are comparable to a Web App; they host the workloads.

Give your container app a name, e.g. *microhack-containerapp*, and choose *Container image* as the deployment source. Make sure that you selected the right resource group.

Use *Spain Central* as the region, since this is where your Container Registry is located.

Next, you will configure the environment by clicking *Create new* under the *Container Apps Environment* field:

In the *Basics* tab, give your environment a name, e.g. *microhack-containerenvironment*, and keep the *Zone redundancy* disabled.

In the *Workload profiles* tab, you can configure the CPU and RAM that is available to the Container Apps in the environment. By default, you have a "Consumption" profile created, which offers up to 4 vCPUs and 8 GiB RAM. If you require more power, you could create additional profiles, but we won't need that for now, so just keep this tab as is.

In the *Monitoring* tab, change the settings to *Don't save logs*; we don't need that at the moment.

Leave the networking tab as is and hit *Create* at the bottom to return to the Container App wizard.

Switch to the *Container* tab.

Give the container a name (e.g., "microhack-webapp") and select an image to deploy.

You want to deploy an image from the Azure Container Registry, so select the registry you created, the image, and the tag.

Select Managed Identity to authenticate to the Azure Container Registry. 

You can also select the amount of resources you want to allocate to the Container App; 1 CPU core and 2 Gi memory should work for now. Leave the *Command override*, *Development stack*, and *Environment variables* as is.

![image](./img/challenge-3-appcontainer.jpg)

Switch to the *Ingress* tab.

Here you can define whether the Container App is accessible from the outside. Click `Enable` to allow traffic to the app.

To make it accessible via the public internet, you must select `Accepting traffic from anywhere`; otherwise, only other Container Apps in the same environment could access the app (this is usually done for internal apps/services).

The target port must match the port that you defined in the Dockerfile (port 8080). Keep the *Insecure connections* as not allowed (but keep this setting in mind for later).

![image](./img/challenge-3-appingress.jpg)

Now hit *Review + create* and *Create* to deploy the Container App. It will not only deploy the app itself but also resources like a load balancer and public IP and automatically configure things like TLS encryption for you.

After the deployment, go to the Container App's *Overview* tab and open the URL to check that everything works (it might take a few minutes for the initial startup after the creation of the Container App):

![image](./img/challenge-3-appurl.jpg)

As you can see, it just requires a few clicks to deploy a container image - no cluster management, no infrastructure configuration, no networking setup - everything is managed for you!

## **Task 2: Automate the deployment with GitHub Actions**

You selected a container image to deploy into the Container App. But what if you make changes and update your app? Always deploying it manually might be inconvenient; instead, you want to automate the deployment in your GitHub Actions workflow.

Therefore, your GitHub Actions workflow needs access to your Azure subscription. Ideally, you do not want to store any credentials anywhere, since they can be leaked or stolen, or you need to have a mechanism in place for rotating the credentials. Instead, you can create a trusted relationship. We will focus on how to set things up and only scratch the surface of how it works under the hood. If you want to know the details, you can check them here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkhkkLBkAT4

First of all, you need a Managed Identity in Azure (comparable to a technical user). Search in the portal for *Managed Identities* and click *Create*. Make sure to choose the right resource group and give your identity a name, e.g. microhack-identity, and create it:

![image](./img/challenge-3-identitycreate.jpg)

If you open the managed identity, you should see this overview. You will later require the subscription id and the client id, so you can copy them to a notepad already.

![image](./img/challenge-3-identityinfo.jpg)

In the *Settings* section, go to the *Federated credentials* tab and hit *+ Add Credential*.

![image](./img/challenge-3-identitycredentials.jpg)

Here, you must be very precise:
* As *Federated credential scenario*, you must choose `Configure a GitHub issued token to impersonate this application and deploy to Azure`.
* Select your GitHub organization name (most likely your GitHub name). You can look it up on the GitHub page: ![image](./img/chellenge-3-githuborgname.jpg)
* The *Repository* is `MicroHack-AppServiceToContainerAppStart` if you did not change it.
* As *Entity*, you must choose `Branch` and as *Branch* set `main`.
* The name is `microhack-identitycredentials`.

You can create the identity now:

![image](./img/challenge-3-identitycredentialscreate.jpg)

This identity will be used from your GitHub Actions workflow. You must assign all necessary permissions and roles that GitHub requires to this identity. Open the resource group that contains the Container App. On the *Access control (IAM)* tab, click on *+ Add* and choose *Add role assignment*:

![image](./img/challenge-3-identityassignment.jpg)

Switch to the *Privileged administrator roles* tab and choose the `Contributor` role.

![image](./img/challenge-3-identityassignment-role.jpg)

On the *Members* tab, select `Managed Identity` and choose the identity you just created and complete the assignment by clicking *Review + assign* and then *Assign*. You can leave all other tabs in default settings.

![image](./img/challenge-3-identityassignment-member.jpg)

The *Contributor* role is very powerful and has very extensive write permissions on the entire resource group. It is generally fine to give these permissions, but in production or real-world scenarios you might want to fine-tune the permissions. In our scenario, GitHub will only interact with the Container App and Container Registry, but now it also has access to the App Service and everything else in the resource group.

Now, you need to store some information in GitHub. Open the *Settings* tab and go to *Secrets and variables* -> *Actions* and create three secrets:
* `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` (the Client ID of the managed identity)
* `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
* `AZURE_TENANT_ID`

![image](./img/challenge-3-repositorysecrets.jpg)

If you don't know how to access your subscription or tenant ID, refer to this:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/get-subscription-tenant-id

Now, you are ready to use the managed identity from the workflow in GitHub. Open the workflow file. Before the `jobs` section (and best after the `on: workflow_dispatch:`) you need to add this section so that GitHub can fetch a token:

	permissions:
   	id-token: write

Then add this step to log in to Azure with the managed identity. You can add it as the first step in the workflow:

    - name: Login to Azure
      uses: azure/login@v2
      with:
        client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
        tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
        subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
    
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
    - name: Setup .NET
      uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
      with:
        dotnet-version: 8.0.x
        
    - name: Restore dependencies
      run: dotnet restore
      
    - name: Build with dotnet
      run: dotnet build --no-restore
      
    - name: Get Latest Container Image Tag
      id: get_tag
      run: |
        TAG=$(az acr repository show-tags --name microhackregistry --repository microhackapp --orderby time_desc --output tsv --detail | head -n 1 | awk '{print $4}')
        NUMERIC_TAG=$(echo "$TAG" | grep -oE '[0-9]+')
        INCREMENTED_TAG=$((NUMERIC_TAG + 1))
        UPDATED_TAG=$(echo "$TAG" | sed "s/$NUMERIC_TAG/$INCREMENTED_TAG/")
        echo "image_tag=$UPDATED_TAG" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        
    - name: Build and Push Image
      run: |
        az acr login --name microhackregistry --username ${{ secrets.ACR_USERNAME }} --password ${{ secrets.ACR_PASSWORD }} &&
        docker build -t microhackregistry.azurecr.io/microhackapp:${{ steps.get_tag.outputs.image_tag }} -f Dockerfile . &&
        docker push microhackregistry.azurecr.io/microhackapp:${{ steps.get_tag.outputs.image_tag }}

    - name: Deploy to Container App
      uses: azure/container-apps-deploy-action@v2
      with:
        imageToDeploy: microhackregistry.azurecr.io/microhackapp:${{ steps.get_tag.outputs.image_tag }}
        acrUsername: ${{ secrets.ACR_USERNAME }}
        acrPassword: ${{ secrets.ACR_PASSWORD }}
        resourceGroup: MicroHack-AppServiceToContainerApp
        containerAppEnvironment: microhack-containerappenvironment
        containerAppName: microhack-containerapp
        targetPort: 8080

You can now make a change to the app and then deploy it to the Container App. Open the `index.cshtml` file in the repository (on the *Code* tab in the *Pages* folder) and add a new line to the landing page of the app, then commit the change and run the workflow again:

![image](./img/challenge-3-changes.jpg)

Open and run the Container App again to verify that the changes worked:

## **On the usage of ACR Credentials**

Right now, your workflow still uses the ACR name and password to authenticate to the Azure Container Registry. Generally, you should avoid using credentials like that (which is why you used a managed identity for the rest). The problem is that right now it is either not directly possible or requires a significant workaround to use managed identities to build and push images into the ACR from GitHub Actions, which would be a little too much for this MicroHack.
